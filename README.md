This repository contains the early codebase for SANSView and SasView that was hosted on SourceForge and at danse.chem.utk.edu.


NOTE:

Many of the \*.zip and \*.tgz files in this repository exceed the file size tracking limit for standard GitHub (>50 Mb using git from the command line, or >25 Mb using the browser interface). Therefore, *all* \*.zip and \*.tgz files in this repository have been committed using [Git Large File Storage (Git-LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). This saves a pointer to the file in the repository, rather than the file itself. Before you can access these files you must first install Git-LFS.

If there is a need to *also* commit other file types to this repository with Git-LFS, you must *first* add that file type to the .gitattributes file. If such a file has already been committed to the local repository without Git-LFS, please see the note at the end of Step 2 in the link above.
